<!-- semantic elements in html 5. 
    these are used to make a webpage browser as well developer friendly.
    they are also used to make pages accesible (equal for everyone for eg- peoples who are blind and cannot able to see properly can acess the webpage properly by website reader)


    instead of div(multiple) we can use semantic tags
